## About us


Hello,

we’re Irene and Lim, professional photographers living and working in Seoul, South Korea.We majored in art and have a great experience for over 4years in Korea and Europe.  And now in work with people all over the world.



We believe your photographs are your legacy, and that each person we photograph has something to leave behind.
We don’t rush, just experience and grasp emotions which float in the air and we capture moments the way they come. If the photos reflect the real atmosphere and both sides are satisfied with the outcome, then We’re satisfied too.
